## Sanam Teri Kasam Movie Review
 
Sanam Teri Kasam may have a beautiful soundtrack and a visually appealing style, but it suffers from a weak and outdated plot that relies on too many cliches and melodrama. The film is a remake of a 1982 film of the same name, which itself was inspired by the classic tale of Beauty and the Beast. However, the film fails to capture the charm and depth of the original story and instead resorts to a senseless sob story that drags on for almost three hours.
 
The film revolves around Saru (Mawra Hocane), a plain-looking librarian who is rejected by her conservative family and potential suitors because of her appearance. She meets Inder (Harshvardhan Rane), a tattooed rebel who lives next door and has a troubled past. They form an unlikely friendship that soon turns into love, but fate has other plans for them. The film tries to portray the transformation of both the characters as they overcome their insecurities and flaws, but it does so in a superficial and unrealistic way.
 
The film's biggest flaw is its script, which is full of loopholes, contradictions and absurdities. The film's logic is questionable at best and laughable at worst. For instance, Saru's family disowns her for cutting her hair, but they don't seem to care about her life-threatening illness. Inder's criminal background is never explained or resolved, and he seems to have unlimited money and resources despite being an outcast. The film also relies on too many coincidences and twists that are neither convincing nor satisfying.
 
The film's saving grace is its music, composed by Himesh Reshammiya, which is melodious and soulful. The songs are well-picturized and suit the mood of the film. The film also has some good cinematography and production design, which create a pleasing visual appeal. The film's lead actors also deliver decent performances, especially Mawra Hocane, who makes an impressive debut in Bollywood. She portrays Saru's innocence and vulnerability with grace and conviction. Harshvardhan Rane also does a fair job as Inder, though he tends to overact at times.
 
Sanam Teri Kasam is a film that could have been much better if it had a tighter and smarter script that did justice to its theme and genre. The film has some moments of romance and emotion, but they are overshadowed by its flaws and excesses. The film is not recommended for those who are looking for a fresh and realistic love story.
