## What is Darkspore and why was it shut down?
 
Darkspore was a spin-off of the popular Spore game, which allowed you to create and evolve your own creatures. However, unlike Spore, Darkspore was focused on combat and loot rather than exploration and creativity. You could choose from hundreds of different heroes, each with their own abilities and stats, and customize them with parts that you collected from enemies or bought from the shop. You could also form a squad of three heroes and switch between them during battles.
 
The game had both single-player and multiplayer modes, where you could team up with other players or compete against them in various challenges. The game also had a dynamic difficulty system that adjusted the enemies and rewards based on your performance. The game was praised for its gameplay variety, customization options, and graphics, but criticized for its repetitive missions, lack of story, and technical issues.
 
Darkspore was released in April 2011 for Windows PC and was available on Steam, Origin, and disc. However, the game suffered from low sales and poor reviews, and EA decided to stop supporting it in 2013. The game's servers were officially shut down in March 2016, making the game unplayable for anyone who owned it. Many fans were disappointed and angry with EA's decision, as they felt that they wasted their money on a game that they could no longer play.
 
Since then, some fans have tried to revive the game by creating mods or hacks that would allow them to play it offline or on private servers. However, this proved to be very difficult, as the game relied heavily on the server-side data and authentication. Many attempts failed or were abandoned, until ReCap came along.
